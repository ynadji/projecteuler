= Euler =
This project is the source code for my solutions to Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net)
problems. I've written solutions in Haskell, Clojure and Common Lisp!

== Haskell ==
* Utils.hs - Utility functions
* euler.hs - Actual solutions to problems (may include some problem-specific functions).

== Clojure (clj/) ==
* nifty_funs.clj - Utility functions
* project-euler.clj - Solutions

== Common Lisp (cl/) ==
* nifty_funs.lisp - Utility functions
* onlisp.lisp - Utility functions that come from Paul Graham's "On Lisp"
* project-euler.lisp - Solutions

== Data (data/) ==
This is a data directory containing files that accompany problems.
